# Momentum App

## This Momentum App stands as a foundational project in my journey as a student at Avion School, showcasing my proficiency in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

Users can personalize their experience by submitting their names for a greeting, specifying their daily focus, customizing the randomly generated quotes, and expanding their to-do lists, providing a dynamic and interactive platform for productivity and motivation.
